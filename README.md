# Oil-Spills-Analysis
This Data Analysis project was conducted in Python for the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program.

## Project Objective
In the United States, hundreds of oils spills are happening every year and can cause large amounts of damage to our enviornment and also be damaging financially. Gaining a scope of where and when these spills are happening and who is to be held accountable will help to prevent more spills from happening in the future.

My goal was to discover the key contributors to these oils spills and analyze the numbers behind them. I will focus on:

- What locations the mojority of these spills happening at.
- What the main causes of these spills are.
- Who is responsible for these spills.
- The costs involved with a spill.

## Data
Open source data from Kaggle on oil spills in the United States from 2010 to early 2017.
